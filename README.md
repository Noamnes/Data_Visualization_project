# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains three distinct machine learning projects focused on different tasks and datasets. Each project is organized in its own directory and contains Jupyter Notebooks for detailed steps and implementations.

## Projects

1. **Cats vs Dogs Classifier**
   - **Description**: A project to classify images of cats and dogs using logistic regression.
   - **Files**:
     - `Cats vs Dogs.ipynb`: Notebook containing the implementation.

2. **Fashion MNIST Classification**
   - **Description**: A project to classify Fashion MNIST dataset using various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost.
   - **Files**:
     - `Fminst.ipynb`: Notebook containing the implementation.
     - `my_default_xgc_model.pkl`: Pre-trained XGBoost model.

3. **Pandas Drawing Analysis**
   - **Description**: A project to analyze hand-drawn pandas using various computational geometry techniques, with no use of learning algorithms from external libraries.
   - **Files**:
     - `Pandas Drawing.ipynb`: Notebook containing the implementation.
     - `train.rar`: Compressed file containing the dataset.
